## Description

This application was created and is used for backend development. This is an employee manager created with the mysql2 node package. It's an application designed for company's to view,update,and manage the employees through a database. It allows you to add,view, and delete roles, departments, and employees within a company. The application is used by the user through a series of prompts to be answered in the command line using nodes inquirer package. These answers directly effect the employee manager database.

My main motivation for this application was to create an application to allow a company, big or small, to manage employees easily. It's a much more simple way to see everything about your company  that you need regarding employees, right in front of your eyes.

## Installation

Before using this generator I first had to make sure I had the necessary applications installed. The applications include [**VS-Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), [**Gitbash**](https://gitforwindows.org/), as well as the latest version of [**node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/download). Next I had to *Follow these steps:*

**1.** Within my project directory I am using the Node Package Manager. I installed this by typing `npm i` into the CLI.

**2.** In this project I am using nodes *inquirer* package, so I then installed *inquirer* by typing `npm install inquirer` into the CLI.

**3.** This application uses information for a database, So I used the *mysql2* package by installing the package by typing `npm install mysql2` into the cli.

**4.** Within this application a secure password was used to connect to the database within the code so I used the .env file to hide credentials. To install the proper usage of this package I typed `npm install dotenv` into the CLI

## Usage

For an employer or myself to use this application you simply make sure you are in the root directory and type `node index.js` into the CLI. From here you are now in the employee manager, and you can add employees, roles, departments, remove them,view everything, and more. Here are a few screenshots determining the live usage:
